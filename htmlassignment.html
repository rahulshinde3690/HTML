<!-- (1) HTML stand for : Hypertext markeup language. -->

<!-- (2) Describe HTML :

An HTML document is a file containing hypertext markup language. HTML code is based on tags, or hidden keywords, which provide instructions for formatting the document. A tag starts with an angle bracket and the 'less than' sign: '<'. The tag ends with an angle bracket and the 'greater than' sign '>'. Tags tell the processing program, often the web browser, what to do with the text. 

For example, to make the word 'Hello' bold, you would use the opening bold tag <b> and then the closing bold tag </b>, like this:

<b>Hello</b>

HTML is defined by the World Wide Web Consortium, an organization that regulates standards for the Internet. Each version of HTML has a set of definitions. Note that HTML is not a programming language. While we often refer to HTML markup as HTML code, programming languages require the processing of logical statements and math. HTML allows the developer to make text documents look engaging and pleasant. In most cases, programming on an HTML document is done with JavaScript. -->

<!-- (3) What is HTML 5 ?

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is an abbreviation of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. The markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. HTML 5 is the fifth and current version of HTML. It has improved the markup available for documents and has introduced application programming interfaces(API) and Document Object Model(DOM).

<!-- (4) Different type of Doctype in HTML ?

Types of HTML
The newest version of HTML, which is entering the industry, is HTML 5. HTML can be divided into three categories: transitional, strict, and frameset. These types apply to how HTML is used, not necessarily to the selection of tags.

{Transitional}
Transitional is the most common type of HTML. It has a flexible syntax, or grammar and spelling component. Over the years, transitional HTML has been used without syntax restrictions, and browsers support a 'best effort' approach to reading the tags. If tags are misspelled, the browsers do not correct web developers' errors, and they display the content anyway. Browsers do not report HTML errors - they simply display what they can. This is the 'best effort' concept.

{Strict}
The strict type of HTML is meant to return rules into HTML and make it more reliable. For example, the strict type requires closing all tags for all opened tags. This style of HTML is important on phones, where the processing power may be limited. A clean and error-free code helps to load pages faster.

{Frameset}
Finally, a frameset allows web developers to create a mosaic of HTML documents where multiple documents can be connected into a single screen. This technique is often used to create a menu system. You click on a menu item on the left side of the screen, and only the right side of the screen re-loads. The menu stays in place.

HTML Examples
Let's take a look at a few examples. To execute the examples, simply create a text document on your desktop called 'test.html'. If you are using a Notepad program, please make sure the extension on the file is .html, not 'test.html.txt'. To do this, use 'Save As' in Notepad and then include in a double-quote the name of the file 'test.html'. On your desktop, you will see an icon with 'test' as the name, and the picture on the icon will have a web browser association.

<!-- (6) What is an Anchor tag and how can you open an URL into a new tab whem clicked ?

add url to the href attribute which you want to open on click and to open URL on new tag use target attribute with _blank value to open URL in new tab. Below is an example of anchor tag.

<!-- (8) Define HTML attribute in HTML ?

HTML Attributes
- All HTML elements can have attributes
- Attributes provide additional information about elements
- Attributes are always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
Example : 
The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

    <a href="https://www.google.com">Visit Google</a> -->

<!-- (9) Define <img> html tag with example.

- The HTML <img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.
- images are linked to web pages. 
- The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
- The <img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
- The <img> tag has two required attributes:
    src - Specifies the path to the image
    alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image -->

<!-- (10) can we modify the attribute's value of the html tag dynamically ?

- Yes,    
    document.getElementByTagName("tag name").setAttribute("attribute name", "value");
-->

<!-- (11) How can we comment in HTML ?
 Only the text inside the {less than ! -- greater than} will be commented out, and the rest of the text inside the tag won't be afected. -->


<!-- (12) What are inline element and block element in HTML ?

- A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available
- An inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary
- The <div> element is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements
- The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document

    <div>	Defines a section in a document (block-level)
    <span>	Defines a section in a document (inline) -->

<!-- (13) Can we change inline element into block level element ? 

You can change the visual presentation of an element using the CSS display property. For example, by changing the value of display from "inline" to "block" , you can tell the browser to render the inline element in a block box rather than an inline box, and vice versa. -->

<!-- (14) describe HTML layout structure.

    <header>:This defines a header for a web page
    <nav>: This defines a container for navigation links
    <section>: This defines a section in a web page
    <article>: This is the primary element that contains information about the web page
    <aside>: The <aside> content is often placed as a sidebar in a document
    <footer>: This defines a footer for a document or a section
    <details>: This is used to define additional details
    <summary>: This defines a heading for the <details> element
Note : above all tag are called as sementice tag as well because tag name suggest there work. -->


<!-- (15) What are <br/> tag in html ?

The <br> tag inserts a single line break. The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems. The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag. -->

<!-- (16) Why meta tags are used in html ?

The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. <meta> tags always go inside the <head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.

Metadata will not be displayed on the page.
Metadata is used by browsers, search engines keywords, and other web services. -->

<!-- (17) Explain list element in html ?

The HTML lists tag is used for specifying a list item is ordered, unordered and menu lists. Lists commonly are found in documents, including web pages. They are an easy and effective way to itemize such things as elements, components, or ingredients.

<!-- (18) What is the difference between DIV and SPAN in html ?

DIV : 

The div element is a block-level element, used to divide page content into blocks. A block element is a page element that starts a new line and has a width equal to the entire page or the parent container.

divs used to group related paragraphs, images, headings, and links. 

For example, a three-paragraph article may be enclosed in a div, and a navigation menu containing links might be enclosed in another div. Using divs this way makes it easier to identify different sections of a page and apply styling to them with CSS.

<div id="poem">
    <p>This is my first poem.</p>
    <p>This is my second poem.</p>
    <p>This is my final poem.</p>    
</div>

SPAN :

The span element is a generic inline element, typically used to apply styling to a portion of inline content. An inline element does not start a new line and only takes up as much space on the page as its content. Span tags are used on small segments of text, links, images, and other HTML elements that appear inline with the surrounding content.

<p>This is a paragraph with <span id=“special-text”>a little something extra</span> inside it.</p> -->
